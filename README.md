    <b>Pass.in is a robust application for managing participants at face-to-face events. This tool offers a series of functionalities designed to facilitate the organization and participation in events, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for both organizers and participants.</b>
</p>

<h2 id="functionalities">Functionalities</h2>

- **Event registration:** Organizers can register new events, specifying details such as title, description and maximum number of participants allowed. Each event is identified by a unique slug generated automatically.
- **Public Registration Page:** After registration, each event has a public page where participants can register. This page is accessible via the event slug.
- **Participant management:** Participants can register for events by providing their personal details. The system ensures that there are no duplicate registrations through email verification.
- **Issuing Credentials:** Registered participants can issue a credential for check-in on the day of the event. This credential is essential for validating entry.
- **Check-In at the Event:** On the day of the event, the system allows participants to check-in by scanning the credentials issued. This process is quick and guarantees security and organization at the entrance to the event.
- **Participant monitoring:** Organizers can view the list of participants registered for each event, as well as the total number of participants.
